# Test evidence

Maps every row of PLAN.md section 11 to the tests that prove it, how to run them, the latest counts, and
where the screenshots for the report go.

## Current status: merged `main`, 28 Sep 2026

A, B and C are merged, so every "not built yet / fails until B and C merge" note further down is resolved.

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Backend `dotnet test` (PostgreSQL 16) | **333 passed**, 0 failed; `dotnet build -warnaserror` clean |
| Agents `pytest` + `ruff check` | **58 passed**, ruff clean |
| React `npm test` + lint + build | **82 passed** (19 files), lint and build clean |
| Flutter `flutter test` + analyze | **68 passed**, no issues |
| E2E Playwright | **6/6 passed** (roles ×4, over-budget → RevisionRequested, demo → approved → Confirmed) |
| k6 `list-load.js` | 610,814 requests, p95 9.56 ms, 0.00 % errors |
| Lighthouse accessibility (landing page) | 100 |

Details, the emulator run and today's fixes: [docs/FINAL-CHECK.md](FINAL-CHECK.md) and
[docs/COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md).

## Snapshot: `docs/spec-compliance` before B and C were merged (26 Sep 2026)

The rest of this document is the per-row mapping written on the A-only branch. The test locations are still valid;
the counts and the "not built yet" statuses are historical.

## How to run each suite

| Suite | Command (from the repo root) | CI workflow |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Backend (unit, integration, database) | `cd backend && TEST_DATABASE_URL="Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=postgres;Username=postgres;Password=…" dotnet test` — without `TEST_DATABASE_URL` the database tests start a `postgres:16-alpine` container with Testcontainers (Docker needed; with colima also set `DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.colima/default/docker.sock TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock`) | `backend-ci.yml` (postgres:16 service, TRX artifact) |
| Agent evaluation | `cd agents && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` | `agents-ci.yml` (`LLM_PROVIDER=fake`) |
| React | `cd web && npm test` (also `npm run lint`, `npm run build`) | `web-ci.yml` |
| Flutter | `cd mobile && flutter analyze && flutter test` | `mobile-ci.yml` |
| End to end | `cd tests/e2e && npm install && npx playwright install chromium && BASE_URL=… API_URL=… E2E_DATABASE_URL=… npx playwright test` (full stack running) | not in CI (needs the stack and a model) |
| Performance | `k6 run tests/perf/list-load.js`, `auth-load.js`, `agent-latency.js` (see `tests/perf/README.md`) | not in CI |

## Counts (latest local run)

| Layer | Component / folder | Tests | Result |
|-------|--------------------|------:|--------|
| Backend | `Tests/Trips` (Student A) | 86 | pass |

| Backend | `Tests/Quotations` (approval gate) | 21 | pass |
| Backend | `Tests/Identity` (auth, tokens, validators, admin audit log) | 21 | pass |
| Backend | `Tests/Shared/Database` (real PostgreSQL) | 18 | pass |
| Backend | `Tests/Common` (health, connection strings, timestamps, error handling, Swagger responses) | 14 | pass |
| Backend | `Tests/Resources` (Student B) | 0 | **not merged yet** |
| **Backend total** | | **235** | **235 passed** (PostgreSQL 16) |
| Agents | `agents/tests/golden` (7 cases) | 17 | pass |
| Agents | `tests/` unit (planner, itinerary, resources, validation, registry, LLM helper, auth) | 26 | pass |
| **Agents total** | | **43** | **43 passed** |
| React | `auth` 10, `features/trips` 13, `features/quotations` 7, `features/resources` 1 | 31 | **31 passed** |
| Flutter | `core` 21, `trips` 18, `quotations` 3, `resources` 3, `shared` 3 | 48 | **48 passed** |
| E2E | `roles.spec.ts` (4), `workflow.spec.ts`, `safe-failure.spec.ts` | 6 | **4 passed, 2 failed** — see below |
| Performance | `list-load`, `auth-load`, `agent-latency` | 3 | list-load and auth-load pass; agent-latency fails its PendingApproval check — see below |

## PLAN.md section 11, row by row

| | Unique and check constraints reject bad rows | `Shared/Database/ConstraintTests` (8 cases) | done |
| | Hold overlap rejected | — | **`resource_holds` belongs to Student B and does not exist yet** |

| End to end | Submit → agents → approve → confirmed | `tests/e2e/workflow.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/safe-failure.spec.ts` | written; **fails until Students B and C merge** (below) |
| Performance | 50 users, 60 s, p95; agent latency over 5 runs | `tests/perf/list-load.js`, `auth-load.js`, `agent-latency.js` | list-load and auth-load pass; agent latency measured, PendingApproval not reachable yet |
| Agent evaluation | Golden, over-budget, injection, tool failure, schema violation, approval enforced | `agents/tests/golden/*` — see `agents/tests/EVALUATION.md` | done (no LLM-as-judge) |

## Results that are not green, and why

**E2E (local stack: PostgreSQL 16, API, agent service on Ollama `llama3.1:8b`, React on port 5199).**
Both specs reach the agents for real: the Planner and Itinerary agents succeed through the real internal API
(attractions from the database, distance from `city_distances`, weather skipped without a key), then the
Resource agent's first tool, `GET /api/internal/availability/guides`, returns **503** from the Resource
Management placeholder, and the workflow ends `FailedSafely` as designed:

```
Error: Agents failed safely: resources: GET /api/internal/availability/guides returned 503
Expected: "PendingApproval"   Received: "FailedSafely"
```

They will pass once Student B registers the real `IResourceCatalog` / `IResourceHoldService` and Student C the
`IQuotationStore` (`backend/src/TripCraft.Infrastructure/Workflows/WorkflowsSetup.cs`). The `resource_holds`
count also needs B's table. The specs are not skipped.

**Performance (same local stack, MacBook, Apple Silicon).**

| Script | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `list-load.js` 50 VUs × 60 s, no think time | 831,741 requests (13,850/s), p95 **7.7 ms**, 0.00 % errors — both thresholds pass |
| `auth-load.js` 20 VUs × 30 s | exactly 5 logins succeeded, 2,135,392 answered 429 by the 5/min/IP limiter (by design), p95 0.6 ms, 0.00 % real errors — thresholds pass |
| `agent-latency.js` 5 sequential runs | 5/5 ended `FailedSafely` at the resources step (same 503 as above) after avg **40.6 s** (min 38.1, max 44.4) of real Planner + Itinerary work; the PendingApproval check fails until B/C merge |

## Where screenshots go

| Folder | What to put there |
|--------|-------------------|
| `docs/evidence/perf/` | `*-summary.json` (written by k6) and a screenshot of each k6 terminal summary |
| `docs/evidence/e2e/` | Playwright screenshots (`approval-review.png`, `approved-toast.png`, `revision-requested.png`); `results/` and `report/` are generated and not committed |
| `docs/evidence/screenshots/` | Passing runs of each suite for the testing report: `dotnet test`, `pytest`, `npm test`, `flutter test`, and the four GitHub Actions runs |

## CI

`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`, `web-ci.yml`, `mobile-ci.yml`, `agents-ci.yml` run on push and pull
request to `main`, with `concurrency: cancel-in-progress`. The repository has no GitHub remote yet, so they
have not run on GitHub; every step of each workflow was run locally with the same commands and passed
(backend in Release against PostgreSQL 16; agents in a fresh Python 3.11 virtualenv with `LLM_PROVIDER=fake`).
